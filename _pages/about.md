I am a first-year PhD student studying computer science at Washington University in St. Louis, advised by [Chenguang Wang](https://cgraywang.github.io/). I am affiliated with WASHU's [NLP group](https://nlp.wustl.edu/). Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, as well as a Master's degree in Computer Science, both at Washington University in St. Louis. 

My research interests include deep learning, large language models, and their applications in scientific domains. Currently, I'm working to improve the accuracy and efficiency of language models, especially on long contexts. When not engaging in research, I'm frequently rock climbing ðŸ§—.
